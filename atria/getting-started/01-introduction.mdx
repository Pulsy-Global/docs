> **Beta timeline**: Atria enters public beta in **Q1 2026**. [Apply for Early Access](https://pulsy.app/contact-atria) to reserve your place in the rollout.

Atria is the event-feed engine for teams that need precise on-chain feeds without spending weeks on internal plumbing. A feed is a small, portable module that listens to blockchain data, applies optional filtering and transformation logic, and ships results to your destinations (webhooks today, more output types in the pipeline).

Use Atria to monitor high-impact transactions, DEX liquidity shifts, bridge flows, stablecoin movements, governance votes, and dozens of other on-chain signals.

The platform removes the need to engineer chain monitoring for specific events from scratch. You define a feed, and Atria handles ingestion, real-time processing, and delivery.

## What Atria Delivers

- **Template Library** – Start from curated feeds that cover the most common DeFi workflows, and extend them to match your stack.
- **Parameter Control** – Tune contracts, chains, token lists, thresholds so feeds only trigger when they matter.
- **Multi-Channel Delivery** – Ship feeds to any destination via webhooks so they drop into your existing pipelines.
- **Hosted or Self-Managed** – Deploy on Pulsy’s managed cloud or drop the runtime into your own infrastructure.

## What You Can Build

- Real-time event monitors and protocol activity tracking.
- Feed processors that normalize and reshape on-chain data into structured payloads.
- Multi-step workflows by combining filters with optional functions for post-processing.
- Data delivery pipelines that fan out results to consumer systems via webhooks.
- Multi-chain combinations.

## Core Pieces

Atria is composed of several services that work together:

- **API**: REST API for managing feeds, outputs, and configuration.
- **Dashboard (SPA)**: Web UI for creating and monitoring feeds.
- **Ingestor**: Connects to blockchains, ingests blocks/logs, and publishes feed data.
- **Runtime**: Executes filters and optional functions on incoming data.
- **Delivery**: Pushes processed data to outputs.
- **Orchestrator**: Manages deployments and health checks for running feeds.

## High-Level Flow

1. **Ingestor** receives blockchain data and publishes feed data to NATS.
2. **Runtime** picks up the feed data, runs your filter and optional function.
3. **Delivery** pushes outputs (webhooks today).
4. **API + Orchestrator** manage lifecycle, health checks, and deployments.

## Data Types

A feed subscribes to a specific data type. These correspond to the kinds of blockchain payloads that Atria ingests and publishes for later-stage processing:

`BlockWithTransactions`
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "networkId": "...",
    "blockNumber": "...",
    "isReorg": false
  },
  "block": {
    "number": "...",
    "hash": "...",
    "timestamp": "...",
    "transactions": [
      {
        "hash": "...",
        "from": "...",
        "to": "...",
        "value": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
`BlockWithLogs`
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "networkId": "...",
    "blockNumber": "...",
    "isReorg": false
  },
  "logs": [
    {
      "address": "...",
      "data": "...",
      "topics": ["..."]
    }
  ]
}
```
`BlockWithTraces` (debug traces)
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "networkId": "...",
    "blockNumber": "...",
    "isReorg": false
  },
  "traces": [
    {
      "txHash": "...",
      "result": {
        "from": "...",
        "to": "...",
        "value": "..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Supported Networks

**Atria Cloud** (mainnets only, for now):
- Ethereum (Mainnet).
- Arbitrum One (Mainnet).
- Optimism (Mainnet).
- Base (Mainnet).
- Polygon (Mainnet).
- BNB Chain (Mainnet).
- Avalanche C-Chain (Mainnet).

**Local deployments**: support any EVM-compatible chain or multiple chains by adding RPC endpoints to the network config.
