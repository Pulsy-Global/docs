# Atria

Atria is the event-feed engine for teams that need precise on-chain alerts without spending weeks on internal plumbing. Pick a template or create a custom one, tune the parameters, and ship production-grade delivery channels in a single session.

Use Atria to monitor high-impact transactions, DEX liquidity shifts, bridge flows, stablecoin movements, governance votes, and dozens of other on-chain signals.

> **Beta timeline**: Atria enters public beta in **Q1 2026**. [Apply for Early Access](https://pulsy.app/contact-atria) to reserve your place in the rollout.

## What Atria Delivers

- **Template Library** – Start from curated feeds that cover the most common DeFi workflows, and extend them to match your stack.
- **Parameter Control** – Tune contracts, chains, token lists, thresholds so alerts only fire when they matter.
- **Multi-Channel Delivery** – Ship feeds to any destination via webhooks so they drop into your existing pipelines.
- **Hosted or Self-Managed** – Deploy on Pulsy’s managed cloud or drop the runtime into your own infrastructure.
