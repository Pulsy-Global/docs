## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate with XFlow for real‑time cross-chain transfer data delivery and how to handle historical backfills.

XFlow provides data in two complementary ways:
- **Historical backfill:** delivered as CSV exports (split by year / month).
- **Real‑time API:** delivered via the external API polling endpoint.

The CSV schema mirrors the API response schema, so you can ingest once and use a single data model in your system.

## Access & Authentication
Reach out to [sales@pulsy.app](mailto:sales@pulsy.app) to coordinate an integration and request an API key. Once provisioned, follow the authentication instructions in the [Authentication guide](/xflow/api-reference/auth).

## API Base URL
Production: `https://api.pulsy.app`.

## Main Polling Endpoint
Transfers (swaps): `GET /v1/external/swaps`. See [Get Swaps](/xflow/api-reference/endpoints/get_swaps) for more details.

**Required query parameters:**
- `from`: ISO‑8601 timestamp (UTC recommended).
- `to`: ISO‑8601 timestamp (UTC recommended).

**Optional query parameter:**
- `filter`: one of `Withdrawn`, `Deposited`, `Completed`, `Updated`.

**Important constraint:**
- The time window between `from` and `to` must not exceed 30 minutes.

## Recommended Polling Strategy
For accurate, forward‑only, and idempotent polling, use `filter=Completed` and the `completedAt` field as your cursor.

**Recommended setup:**
- Job A (real‑time): poll with no delay.
- Job B (delayed): poll with a 48‑hour delay to capture late‑arriving transfers.

**Cursor logic:**
1. Ingest the historical CSV export.
2. Start both pollers from `max(completedAt)` found in the CSV.
3. After each API response, advance your cursor to the max `completedAt` returned by that response.

`completedAt` is stable (it is set when a transfer record reaches its final state). This makes forward‑only polling safe.

## Historical Backfill via CSV
- CSV exports are provided for historical data (split by year / month).
- Use CSVs for backfill. The external API is intended for real‑time polling only.
- The polling API is not intended for deep historical backfill. Use CSV exports instead.
- We periodically regenerate historical exports as protocols and patterns evolve. Implement a re‑fill flow so you can re‑ingest refreshed exports when provided.

## Timestamp Fields (Polling & Reconciliation)
Key timestamps available in both CSV and API:
- `detectedAt`: when a transfer was detected by XFlow.
- `completedAt`: when a transfer was finalized and made available in the external API.
- `updatedAt`: when a transfer record was last changed.
- `depositedAt`: inbound on‑chain transaction time.
- `withdrawnAt`: outbound on‑chain transaction time.

## Rate Limits & Integration Tiers
Polling rate limits are set per integration tier and use case. Reach out to [sales@pulsy.app](mailto:sales@pulsy.app) to discuss your requirements and confirm limits.
