# XFlow

XFlow is a cross-chain explorer for teams that need real-time visibility into bridge activity and cross-chain liquidity flows. Powered by the broader [Pulsy Tracking System](https://pulsy.app/#offerings), XFlow combines 70+ bridge integrations with seamless delivery options.

XFlow continuously watches 2,000+ on-chain bridge contracts and events, spanning both current and legacy bridge contracts. The system matches inbound and outbound legs, enriches them with sender and receiver accounts, identifies the bridged token, and timestamps everything so you can reconstruct a full transfer lifecycle.

On a daily basis, XFlow processes 150,000+ bridging events across supported bridges and chains.

Explore the [API](/xflow/api-reference/endpoints/get_swaps) to see the exact schemas, parameters, and filtering options exposed by XFlow, or download the [OpenAPI Spec](https://api.pulsy.app/swagger/ExternalAPI/swagger.json) directly.

## What XFlow Delivers

- **Extensive Chain Coverage** – Track cross-chain flows across major blockchains.
- **Integration-Ready** – Use the API to programmatically route events into dashboards, alerting, or automation.
- **Custom-Branded Explorer** – Offer your users a white-labeled bridge explorer powered by the same dataset the Pulsy team maintains.

## Explorer

Jump into the live explorer at [xflow.pulsy.app/bridges](https://xflow.pulsy.app/bridges) to search, analyse, and filter cross-chain swaps in real time.

The explorer also surfaces liquidity flows between supported chains, overall tracked dollar volumes, and cross-chain swap counts so you can see how traffic shifts across the ecosystems.

## Coverage

- **Bridge & Chain Coverage** – The home page of the XFlow app [xflow.pulsy.app](https://xflow.pulsy.app) lists the currently supported bridges and chains, so you always know which ecosystems are tracked.
- **Programmatic Lookup** – Use the [Get Bridges API](/xflow/api-reference/endpoints/get_bridges), [Get Chains API](/xflow/api-reference/endpoints/get_chains), and [Get Tokens API](/xflow/api-reference/endpoints/get_tokens) to retrieve the latest supported entities directly in your workflows.
